        <h3>History</h3>
          <p>Since 1880, the Cornell Dairy has been producing wholesome diary products for the campus and Ithaca communities. Made of the highest-quality milk from Cornell's own dairy cows, our rich and creamy premium ice creams are handcrafted in small batches by student apprentices and their professional mentors.</p>
          <p>Discover for yourself why generations of Cornellians have adored our sweet selection of favorite flavors and one-of-a-kind creations. Your enjoyment of this product supports essential education and outreach programs in the Department of Food Science.</p>

        <h3>Facilities</h3>
        <h4>The Dairy Processing Plant</h4>
          <p>The Cornell Dairy Processing Plant supports the primary teaching, research and outreach missions of the Department of Food Science, the Cornell Institute of Food Science and the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. Specifically, the Cornell Dairy contributes to undergraduate and graduate instruction in food science; to basic and applied dairy food research; to public service through extension programs; and as a designated training facility for New York State Certified Milk Inspectors and New York State Department of Agriculture and Market Inspectors. </p>
          <p>As a by-product of its mission-based functions, the Cornell Dairy also produces milk, yogurt, juice and ice cream products to be sold on campus at Cornell University to offset the total costs incurred in the equipping and operations of the dairy plant.</p>
